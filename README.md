# 🎨 DrawSpace – Web-Based VR Drawing Experience

**DrawSpace** is an experimental drawing application that bridges traditional 2D sketching with immersive 3D/VR environments. Initially designed for mouse-based input, this project sets the stage for a fully interactive, spatial drawing experience using WebXR.

## 🚀 Features

- 🖱️ **Mouse-Driven 2D Drawing**  
  Prototype enables smooth freehand sketching using standard mouse input.

- 🎚️ **Adjustable Line Width & Dynamic Colors**  
  Customize brush size and color on the fly.

- 🧠 **Efficient Memory Usage**  
  Each line uses a material property block for optimized performance.

- 🕹️ **WebXR-Ready**  
  Engineered with future VR input compatibility in mind.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Unity** (WebGL Build)  
- **C#**  
- **WebXR Export Plugin** *(planned for future integration)*

## 🧩 Upcoming Features

- 🎮 **VR Controller-Based 3D Drawing**  
  Draw in 3D space using hand-held controllers.

- 💾 **Sketch Persistence**  
  Save and load drawings as reusable 3D assets.

## 💡 Motivation

DrawSpace began as a personal exploration into **spatial computing** and **immersive interaction design**. The focus is on creating intuitive tools for creative expression in virtual environments — emphasizing lightweight performance, expandability, and meaningful UX.
