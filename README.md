🎨 DrawSpace – Web-Based VR Drawing Experience
DrawSpace is an experimental drawing application that bridges traditional 2D sketching with immersive 3D/VR environments. Initially designed for mouse-based input, this project sets the stage for a fully interactive, spatial drawing experience using WebXR.

🚀 Features
🖱️ Mouse-Driven 2D Drawing
Prototype enables smooth freehand sketching using standard mouse input.

🎚️ Adjustable Line Width & Dynamic Colors
Customize brush size and color on the fly.

🧠 Efficient Memory Usage
Each line uses a material property block for optimized performance.

🕹️ WebXR-Ready
Engineered with future VR input compatibility in mind.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Unity (WebGL Build)

C#

WebXR Export Plugin (planned for future integration)

🧩 Upcoming Features
🎮 VR Controller-Based 3D Drawing
Draw in 3D space using hand-held controllers.

💾 Sketch Persistence
Save and load drawings as reusable 3D assets.

💡 Motivation
DrawSpace began as a personal exploration into spatial computing and immersive interaction design. The focus is on creating intuitive tools for creative expression in virtual environments — emphasizing lightweight performance, expandability, and meaningful UX.
