# DrawSpace – Web-Based VR Drawing Experience

**DrawSpace** is an experimental drawing application that bridges traditional 2D sketching with immersive 3D/VR environments. Initially designed for mouse-based input, this project sets the stage for a fully interactive, spatial drawing experience using WebXR.

##  Features

-  **Mouse-Driven 2D Drawing**  
  Prototype enables smooth freehand sketching using standard mouse input.

-  **Adjustable Line Width & Dynamic Colors**  
  Customize brush size and color on the fly.

-  **Efficient Memory Usage**  
  Each line uses a material property block for optimized performance.

-  **WebXR-Ready**  
  Engineered with future VR input compatibility in mind.

##  Tech Stack

- **Unity**
- **C#**  

##  Upcoming Features

-  **VR Controller-Based 3D Drawing**  
  Draw in 3D space using hand-held controllers.

-  **Sketch Persistence**  
  Save and load drawings as reusable 3D assets.

##  Motivation

DrawSpace began as a personal exploration into **spatial computing** and **immersive interaction design**. The focus is on creating intuitive tools for creative expression in virtual environments — emphasizing lightweight performance, expandability, and meaningful UX.
